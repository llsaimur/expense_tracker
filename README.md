Expense Tracker is an application to create an expense tracking system with robust data visualization capabilities.
We developed an Expense model to manage expense details and implemented CRUD functionalities to enable users to record, view, and modify their expenses seamlessly.

Additionally, I integrated data processing and visualization features to provide users with insights into their spending habits, including category-wise expenditure and trends over different time periods.
Leveraging MongoDB's aggregation framework, we gained proficiency in advanced data processing techniques, and I utilized customizable chart components from Victory to render various types of charts for enhanced visualization.
Through this process, I gained valuable experience in leveraging MongoDB's aggregation framework and integrating external libraries like Victory for sophisticated data visualization tasks.
